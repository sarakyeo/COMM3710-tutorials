## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. Use the `ifelse()` function to recode a variable
2. Create a new variable by summing existing variables

We will use the `mpg` dataset from `ggplot2`, which has already been loaded for you in this tutorial. If you need to review the `mpg` dataset, open its help page (`?mpg`).


## Recoding variables
**Recode** is a term used to describe the process of making changes to the values of a variable. Recoding a variable often involves changing values in an existing variable to make a new one.

Let's say we want to create a new variable that categorizes the cars in our dataset into two categories based on whether they have high or low city gas mileage. The variable for this is `cty`.
